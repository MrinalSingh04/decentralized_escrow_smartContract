# Decentralized Escrow Smart Contract ðŸ”’

## Overview

This is a **trustless escrow smart contract** that ensures secure transactions between two parties. The funds are locked in escrow and released only when both parties fulfill the agreement. An optional arbitrator can resolve disputes if necessary.

## Features

âœ… **Secure Transactions** â€“ Funds are held in escrow until conditions are met.  
âœ… **Third-Party Arbitrator (Optional)** â€“ A mediator can resolve disputes.  
âœ… **Automated Refunds** â€“ If conditions arenâ€™t met, funds are returned.  
âœ… **No Middleman Required** â€“ Uses smart contract logic to enforce agreements.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity** â€“ Smart contract language.
- **Hardhat** â€“ Development and testing framework.
- **Ethers.js** â€“ For interaction with the contract.

## Use Cases

ðŸ”¹ **Freelance Work** â€“ Payment is held in escrow until the work is delivered.  
ðŸ”¹ **E-commerce Transactions** â€“ Prevents fraud in online purchases.  
ðŸ”¹ **Real Estate & Rentals** â€“ Holds deposits securely until terms are met.  
ðŸ”¹ **OTC Crypto Trading** â€“ Ensures both parties fulfill their obligations.

## How It Works

1. **Buyer deposits funds** into the smart contract.
2. **Seller completes the service/delivery.**
3. **Buyer approves the transaction**, releasing funds to the seller.
4. **If a dispute arises, an arbitrator can resolve it (optional).**

        payable(seller).transfer(amount);
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }

    function raiseDispute() public onlyBuyer {
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Cannot dispute now");
        currentState = State.DISPUTED;
        isDisputed = true;
    }

    function resolveDispute(bool favorBuyer) public onlyArbitrator {
        require(currentState == State.DISPUTED, "No dispute to resolve");

        if (favorBuyer) {
            payable(buyer).transfer(amount);
        } else {
            payable(seller).transfer(amount);
        }
